.SH NAME
overstrike \(em replace overstrikes by multiple lines
.\" ============================================================================
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B overstrike
.\" ============================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B overstrike
copies its input to its output, replacing lines containing backspaces by
multiple lines that overstrike to print the same as the input, but contain no
backspaces.
It is assumed that the output is to be printed on a device that takes the first
character of each line as a cariage control; a blank carriage control causes
normal space before print, while a plus sign
.RB \(aq + \(aq
suppresses space before print and hence causes the remainder of the line to
overstrike the previous line.
.\" ============================================================================
.SH BUGS
.B overstrike
is naive about vertical motions and non-printing characters.
It produces one overstruck line for each sequence of backspaces.
